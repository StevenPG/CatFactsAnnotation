# CatFacts Annotation Project

This project is based on a GitLab [Project Template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html).

Improvements can be proposed in the [original project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/spring).

## Purpose
This project exists as an extremely simple java only configuration example on how to write custom Aspect Annotations in Spring. The project is properly version controlled and will be deployed to maven central. The steps followed to deploy the application to maven central will be listed here.

Once deployed, anyone can download the dependency and annotate their classes with @CatFacts, which will print a catfact to STDOUT whenever the method is called.

## Usage
For your Spring application to find the CatFacts advice, you will need to add 

    @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.stevenpg"})

to your SpringApplication file. This will allow Spring to pick up and load the CatFactsAspect into your Spring Context.

Usage of the annotation is as follows:

    @CatFacts
	@GetMapping("/")
	String home() {
		return "Spring is here!";
	}

Here is the sample output:

## Project Reference Steps

### Creating a Custom Annotation - Components

These components should be all that is needed in Spring 2 to create a custom annotation that will execute a method on every method it is attached to.

[Aspect file example](https://gitlab.com/StevenPG/customspringaopannotation/wikis/aspect)

[Inteface file example](https://gitlab.com/StevenPG/customspringaopannotation/wikis/interface)

The interface defines the annotation, and the aspect file links when it is supposed to activate. This is the class that needs to be available in the spring context for the annotation to work properly.

### Caveats and Gotchas

1. You'll need to remember to add the `@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.stevenpg"})` to your SpringApplication. Excluding this will not throw an error, but no cat facts will be logged as the aspect will not be loaded into the Spring Context.

2. Don't name a controller mapping `catFactsMappingTest`. This seems to clash with the unit test in the CatFactsAnnotation library. I'm actively investigating how to make this not happen, but it's just a mini-gotcha no-one should ever run into.

### Github vs Gitlab

This repository is mirrored locally between Github and Gitlab. I personally prefer Gitlab, but have both listed as remotes. Any changes made to Github will be propogated to Gitlab during the pull request process.

    git push origin
    git push github

Both are set as remotes and manually pushed and pulled as changes require.

### Creating a Release

The initial release is formatted like so:

    <groupId>com.stevenpg.aop</groupId>
    <artifactId>CustomAopAnnotation</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
	<packaging>jar</packaging>
	
The release will be uploaded to Gitlab for manual pulling, and I intend to deploy the jar with sources to Maven Central.

### Uploading the Maven Central
