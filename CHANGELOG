## v1.0

Initial release

- uploaded to maven central under the wrong name
- included all of the test dependencies in the base jar
- didn't comment the code at all
- got 100% test coverage but didn't use an external tool or set any badges in README
- forgot to setup maven badge in readme for v1.0
- jar that prints cat facts is 19MB...
- everything was done in master, no fun branching strategy or release branches

I intend to fix everything above in v2.0, as well as redeploy a 2.0 and 2.1 which are linked to their specific version of spring. Probably.
